                Plans should ensure continued access to the most highly valued
                areas for each sector. This report summarizes how much value
                falls within this MPA plan for each sector . The higher the
                percentage, the greater the potential impact if access or
                activities are restricted.

                  To capture the value each sector places on different areas
                  within Bermuda waters, an Ocean Use Survey was conducted.
                  Individuals identified the sectors they participate in, and
                  were asked to draw the areas they use relative to that sector
                  and assign a value of importance. Individual responses were
                  then combined to produce aggregate heatmaps by sector.

                <p>
                  Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the
                  individuals that were surveyed.
